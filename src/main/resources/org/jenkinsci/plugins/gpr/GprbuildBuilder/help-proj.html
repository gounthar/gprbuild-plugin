    GPRbuild requires a project file, which may be specified on the command line
    either directly or through the <code>-P</code> switch. If not specified,
    GPRbuild uses the project file <em>default.gpr</em> if there is one in the
    current working directory. Otherwise, if there is only one project file in
    the current working directory, GPRbuild uses this project file.
